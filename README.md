## Description  

The "BigMood" web app gives users an easy way to track their mood throughout the day. After they are asked to create an account, users will log in to the app and create a new entry where they are prompted to report how they are feeling on a 1-5 scale (their mood), and what their current activity is. They will also be presented with a randomly chosen inspirational quote. On subsequent logins, in addition to recording their current mood and activity, users will be able to view all past entries, see a graph displaying their average mood, view their most used activity, and change the theme of the app. 

The deployed app can be found online here: [BigMood App](https://https://bigmoodapp.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation   

This app was designed to address the issue of wanting to become more aware of changes in mood throughout the day. It gives our users a simple, non-obtrusive way to track their mood and accompanying activities, to ultimately help them become more aware of their mental states. Noticing and identifying moods, and being able to look back and analyze mood changes, will hopefully allow our users to focus more on doing activities that are correlated with a positive mood, and to hopefully avoid those activities that are correlated with negative mood.

## Installation and Usage  

There is nothing to install to use this web app. New users must create a login that requires them to enter in an email address, username, and password. They will then be presented with a Dashboard where they can see relevant statistics about their mood/activity entries, and a button to create a new entry. After they create a new entry, the app will immediately save and display the entry in the "All Entries" list, and incorporate the new data into the Average Mood and Most Used Activity tabs. Users will also be able to read a new inspirational quote every time that they log in to the app, and will be able to alter the color theme of the app through a drop-down menu accessed through a side-menu icon. Users will also be able to Logout of the app or view the GitHub profiles of the developers by accessing the side-menu.

## Future Development  

We will continue to make adjustments to the UI layout and functionality until the app is perfect in every way. 

A larger feature to incorporate would be allowing users to add in their own personal activities to the activity list.
